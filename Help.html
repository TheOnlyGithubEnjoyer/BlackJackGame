        <h2>These are the Rules: </h2>
        <p>The dealer will give you two cards and himself two. Once you have a number you either press (Hit) or (Stand).
            (Stand) will make you stay with the cards that you have. (Hit) will make you get another card until you're either satisfied or if you (Bust). 
            (Bust) is when you go over and exceed 21 and lose. Once you have made your decision and satisfied with your number, the dealer will either flip one or more cards until he either busts or wins.
            The dealer will automatically stand over 17. The dealer may also bust if he gets a number which is higher than 21. But if the dealer has a bigger number than you which is between 17 and 21, you lose.
